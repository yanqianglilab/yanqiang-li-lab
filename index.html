      We develop computational and experimental approaches to decode gene regulation and diverse RNA modifications,
      with a focus on Nanopore direct RNA sequencing
    

Yanqiang Li — Professor, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University. 
      I earned my Ph.D. from the Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2016, mentored by Prof. Renyi Liu.
      From August 2016, I pursued postdoctoral training in bioinformatics at Johns Hopkins University, mentored by Prof. Zhibin Wang.
      From July 2018 to October 2020, I continued postdoctoral research at Houston Methodist Hospital, Cornell University, mentored by Prof. Kaifu Chen.
      I then conducted further bioinformatics postdoctoral work at Harvard Medical School in Kaifu's Lab and became an Instructor there in October 2022.
      In March 2025, I joined The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi’an Jiaotong University as a Professor,
      focusing on tumor RNA modifications and oncogenic mechanisms.
    

### Research Themes

- for sensitive detection of low-abundance and hard‑to‑map RNA modifications.

- driven by dysregulated RNA modification pathways.

- targeting RNA modification regulators for precision oncology.
