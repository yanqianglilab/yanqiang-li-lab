## Overview
The Epigenetics & Computational RNA Biology Laboratory focuses on basic and translational research on RNA modifications in cancer, with an emphasis on Nanopore direct RNA sequencing (dRNA-seq) and AI-driven computational methods. We aim to bridge technology development with mechanistic discovery and therapeutic exploration.

## Direction 1 — AI-enabled detection of RNA modifications
Many RNA modifications are low-abundance and difficult to localize. We develop computational methods that integrate Nanopore dRNA-seq signals to sensitively map RNA modifications (e.g., Nm, Ψ, m6A) and quantify modification dynamics across conditions.

**Representative outputs**
- Algorithms and pipelines for modification calling from Nanopore signals  
- Benchmarking and validation using orthogonal assays and perturbation systems

## Direction 2 — RNA modification mechanisms in urological cancers
We investigate how RNA modification regulators are dysregulated in urological cancers and how these changes reshape RNA stability, translation, and oncogenic pathways. We combine multi-omics profiling with functional validation to elucidate causal mechanisms.

**Representative questions**
- How do RNA modification regulators control tumor progression and therapy response?
- How do modifications affect RNA stability and translation programs in cancer cells?

## Direction 3 — Targeting RNA modification pathways for precision oncology
Based on mechanistic insights, we explore therapeutic strategies that target RNA modification pathways, including candidate regulators and downstream vulnerabilities, aiming to identify actionable biomarkers and treatment opportunities.

## Methods & Platforms
- Nanopore direct RNA-seq (signal-level analysis)
- Machine learning & statistical modeling
- Multi-omics integration (RNA-seq, Ribo-seq, RIP/CLIP, etc.)
- Functional perturbation and validation
