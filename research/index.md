## Overview
We are the Epigenetics & Computational RNA Biology Group, dedicated to basic and translational research on RNA modifications in cancer. We place a core emphasis on Nanopore direct RNA sequencing (dRNA-seq) and AI-driven computational methods, with a clear goal to bridge cutting-edge technology development with in-depth mechanistic discovery and clinical therapeutic exploration. Our research is centered on urologic oncology, with a primary focus on genitourinary cancers such as prostate cancer, the key research direction of the Urology Department at The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University.
We develop and optimize advanced computational algorithms, integrative multi-omics analytical pipelines, and novel experimental methodologies tailored for RNA modification research. These technical systems enable us to accurately detect and comprehensively characterize a variety of RNA modifications—including 2'-O-methylation, m6A, ac4C, psU, and A-to-I RNA editing—from diverse high-throughput sequencing data, such as Nanopore dRNA-seq, RNA-seq, Ribo-seq and RIP-seq. By combining computational bioinformatics approaches with experimental validation, we conduct in-depth investigations into the functional roles of RNA modifications and their regulatory factors in the initiation and progression of urologic cancers.
We aim to unravel how aberrant RNA modification patterns drive malignant biological behaviors of urologic tumor cells, including abnormal proliferation, invasion and metastasis. We also explore the intricate crosstalk between RNA modification regulators and key oncogenic signaling pathways in urologic oncology, revealing the underlying molecular networks that govern cancer development and progression. Leveraging the valuable molecular insights gained from our fundamental research, we strive to identify specific and reliable RNA modification-related biomarkers for the early diagnosis, prognostic evaluation and risk stratification of urologic cancers.
Furthermore, we focus on exploring novel therapeutic targets and innovative treatment strategies targeting RNA modification regulatory networks, committed to translating our basic research findings into clinical applications. Our work aims to provide new molecular perspectives for understanding the pathogenesis of urologic cancers, and to develop more precise and effective diagnostic tools and therapeutic regimens for urologic tumor treatment, ultimately advancing the translational application of RNA modification research in clinical oncology and improving the clinical management and treatment outcomes of urologic cancer patients.

## AI-enabled detection of RNA modifications
Many RNA modifications are low-abundance and difficult to localize. We develop computational methods that integrate Nanopore direct RNA-seq signals to precisely map RNA modifications (e.g., Nm, Ψ, m6A) and quantify modification dynamics across conditions.

## Regulation of RNA modifications in urological cancers
We investigate how RNA modification regulators are dysregulated in urological cancers and how these changes reshape RNA stability, translation, and oncogenic pathways.

## Targeting RNA modification pathways for precision oncology
Based on mechanistic insights, we explore therapeutic strategies that target RNA modification pathways to identify actionable biomarkers and treatment opportunities.
