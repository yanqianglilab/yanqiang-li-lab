## Overview
The Epigenetics & Computational RNA Biology Laboratory focuses on basic and translational research on RNA modifications in cancer, with an emphasis on Nanopore direct RNA sequencing (dRNA-seq) and AI-driven computational methods. We aim to bridge technology development with mechanistic discovery and therapeutic exploration.

## Direction 1 — AI-enabled detection of RNA modifications
Many RNA modifications are low-abundance and difficult to localize. We develop computational methods that integrate Nanopore dRNA-seq signals to sensitively map RNA modifications (e.g., Nm, Ψ, m6A) and quantify modification dynamics across conditions.

## Direction 2 — RNA modification mechanisms in urological cancers
We investigate how RNA modification regulators are dysregulated in urological cancers and how these changes reshape RNA stability, translation, and oncogenic pathways.

## Direction 3 — Targeting RNA modification pathways for precision oncology
Based on mechanistic insights, we explore therapeutic strategies that target RNA modification pathways to identify actionable biomarkers and treatment opportunities.

## Methods & Platforms
- Nanopore direct RNA-seq (signal-level analysis)
- Machine learning & statistical modeling
- Multi-omics integration
- Functional perturbation and validation
